# GSoC 2025 Project Report: Developing an ISPC Backend for GeNN

## A Bird's Eye Overview

My project was [Developing an ISPC Backend for GeNN](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/), focusing on bridging the performance gap between single-threaded CPU implementations and GPU-accelerated neural network simulations. I proposed to achieve this by creating a comprehensive ISPC (Intel SPMD Program Compiler) backend that leverages SIMD parallelization capabilities of modern processors, continuing GeNN's mission to make high-performance neural network simulations accessible across diverse hardware platforms.

The project integrates **SIMD vectorization techniques** with **neural network simulation frameworks**, leveraging **Intel's SPMD programming model** to create efficient CPU-based implementations that maintain compatibility with existing GeNN models while providing significant performance improvements over traditional scalar approaches.

## Abstract

This report presents the development of an Intel SPMD Program Compiler (ISPC) backend for GeNN (GPU-Enhanced Neuronal Networks), a code generation framework for accelerated spiking neural network simulations. The project aimed to bridge the performance gap between single-threaded CPU implementations and GPU-accelerated simulations by leveraging SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) parallelization capabilities of modern processors.

The implementation involved creating a complete ISPC code generation pipeline within GeNN's existing backend architecture, including kernel generation for neuron updates, synaptic processing, and custom operations. Key contributions include optimized memory access patterns, efficient gather/scatter operations for sparse connectivity, and comprehensive benchmarking across different platforms. Performance evaluations demonstrate significant speedups over single-threaded CPU implementations while maintaining compatibility with existing GeNN models and providing better portability than GPU-only solutions.

## Need for the Project

As the demand for accessible neural network simulation tools continues to grow, so do the challenges related to hardware accessibility, performance optimization, and cross-platform compatibility. This project addresses these challenges by utilizing Intel's SPMD Program Compiler (ISPC) to create realistic SIMD-accelerated simulations of neural networks. According to recent studies on parallel computing architectures, SIMD-based approaches possess advanced vectorization capabilities and efficient memory utilization patterns, allowing them to act as a bridge between single-threaded CPU and GPU implementations.

### Background on Neural Simulations and GeNN

GeNN (GPU-Enhanced Neuronal Networks) is a C++ library designed to facilitate the simulation of spiking neural networks on parallel hardware. Originally developed to harness the computational power of GPUs through CUDA, GeNN generates optimized code for various neuron and synapse models, enabling researchers to simulate large-scale neural networks efficiently.

The framework employs a code generation approach where user-defined models are translated into optimized kernel code. This design allows for high performance while maintaining flexibility in model definition. GeNN supports various backends including CUDA for NVIDIA GPUs and single-threaded CPU implementations.

### The Performance Gap Challenge

The need for an ISPC backend arose from several critical limitations in the existing GeNN ecosystem:

1. **Hardware Accessibility Crisis**: Not all researchers have access to high-end GPUs, creating a significant barrier to entry for high-performance neural network simulations.

2. **Performance Cliff**: Single-threaded CPU implementations often exhibit 10-20x slower performance compared to GPU versions, creating an unacceptable performance gap for users without specialized hardware.

3. **SIMD Underutilization**: Modern CPUs feature powerful SIMD instruction sets (SSE, AVX, AVX-512) that remain largely untapped in traditional scalar CPU implementations, representing a massive waste of available computational resources.

4. **Cross-Platform Portability**: ISPC provides a unified programming model that can target multiple architectures (x86, ARM) and instruction sets, offering better portability than CUDA while maintaining high performance.

By integrating ISPC-based agents into GeNN's backend architecture, the project aims to democratize access to high-performance neural network simulations, focusing on emergent SIMD optimization patterns and overall system performance characteristics.

## The Final Framework: GeNN-ISPC

> _As it is often said, performance is not just about speed. It's about creating solutions that scale._

Meaning, instead of just optimizing individual kernels for SIMD execution, I wanted to build a comprehensive backend framework to create a sustainable solution that can be leveraged across the entire GeNN ecosystem.

And hence, I created the <span class="framework-name">GeNN-ISPC Backend</span>.
