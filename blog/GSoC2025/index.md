## Abstract

This report presents the development of an Intel SPMD Program Compiler (ISPC) backend for GeNN (GPU-Enhanced Neuronal Networks), a code generation framework for accelerated spiking neural network simulations. The project aimed to bridge the performance gap between single-threaded CPU implementations and GPU-accelerated simulations by leveraging SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) parallelization capabilities of modern processors.

The implementation involved creating a complete ISPC code generation pipeline within GeNN's existing backend architecture, including kernel generation for neuron updates, synaptic processing, and custom operations. Key contributions include optimized memory access patterns, efficient gather/scatter operations for sparse connectivity, and comprehensive benchmarking across different platforms. Performance evaluations demonstrate significant speedups over single-threaded CPU implementations while maintaining compatibility with existing GeNN models and providing better portability than GPU-only solutions.

## Introduction & Need for the Project

### Background on Neural Simulations and GeNN

GeNN (GPU-Enhanced Neuronal Networks) is a C++ library designed to facilitate the simulation of spiking neural networks on parallel hardware. Originally developed to harness the computational power of GPUs through CUDA, GeNN generates optimized code for various neuron and synapse models, enabling researchers to simulate large-scale neural networks efficiently.

The framework employs a code generation approach where user-defined models are translated into optimized kernel code. This design allows for high performance while maintaining flexibility in model definition. GeNN supports various backends including CUDA for NVIDIA GPUs and single-threaded CPU implementations.

### Motivation for ISPC Backend

The need for an ISPC backend arose from several limitations in the existing GeNN ecosystem:

1. **Hardware Accessibility**: Not all researchers have access to high-end GPUs, limiting the adoption of GeNN's GPU-accelerated features.

2. **Performance Gap**: Single-threaded CPU implementations often exhibit poor performance compared to GPU versions, creating a significant performance cliff for users without GPU access.

3. **SIMD Underutilization**: Modern CPUs feature powerful SIMD instruction sets (SSE, AVX, AVX-512) that remain largely untapped in traditional scalar CPU implementations.

4. **Cross-Platform Portability**: ISPC provides a unified programming model that can target multiple architectures (x86, ARM) and instruction sets, offering better portability than CUDA.

### Problem Statement

The primary challenge was to develop a backend that could:
- Leverage SIMD parallelization for neural network computations
- Provide performance between single-threaded CPU and GPU implementations
- Maintain compatibility with existing GeNN model definitions
- Support cross-platform deployment (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Handle complex memory access patterns inherent in neural network simulations
